Doom Game written in Python with Pygame

This is a game done by following the Youtube tutorial found here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ&t=433s&ab_channel=CoderSpace

It is coded completely in Python using Pygame and tackles some tough game development concepts such as 
- Pathfinding (using BFS) 
- Creating AI for NPCs (Non player character) so that they're chasing the player and trying to kill the player
- Raycasting and rendering a 2D world to look like a 3D world in a FPS (First Person Shooter)
- Rendering sprites and animating them
- Sound and music playback
- and more...
